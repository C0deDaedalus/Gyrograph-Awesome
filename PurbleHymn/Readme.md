# PurbleHymn
Collection of Gyrographs based on my beautiful imagination following a similar theme

# What the theme can be
All these Gyrographs can be thought to fall under the canopy of -
* [Rangoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangoli "The Great Indian Art") pattens
* Audio Vizualizations as in a media player. That I often do
* Anything you can beautifully imagine. It's upto you.
